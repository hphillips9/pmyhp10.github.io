abstract = {The game of cops and robbers is played with a set of ‘cops’ and a ‘robber’ who occupy some vertices of a graph. Both sides have perfect information and they move alternately to adjacent vertices. The robber is captured if at least one of the cops occupies the same vertex as the robber. The problem is to determine on a given graph, G, the least number of cops sufficient to capture the robber, called the cop-number, c(G). We investigate this game on three products of graphs: the Cartesian, categorical, and strong products.}

abstract = {We examine a version of the cops and robbers (CR) game in which the robber is invisible, i.e., the cops do not know his location until they capture him. Apparently this game (CiR) has received little attention in the CR literature. We examine two variants: in the first, the robber is adversarial (he actively tries to avoid capture); in the second, he is drunk (he performs a random walk). Our goal in this paper is to study the invisible cost of drunkenness (iCOD), which is defined as the ratio cti(G)/dcti(G), with cti(G) and dcti(G) being the expected capture times in the adversarial and drunk CiR variants, respectively. We show that these capture times are well defined, using game theory for the adversarial case and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) for the drunk case. We give exact asymptotic values of the iCOD for several special graph families such as d-regular trees, give some bounds for grids, and provide general upper and lower bounds for general classes of graphs. We also give an infinite family of graphs showing that the iCOD can be arbitrarily close to any value in [2,∞). Finally, we briefly examine one more CiR variant, in which the robber is invisible and “infinitely fast”; we argue that this variant is significantly different from the graph search game, despite several similarities between the two games.}

  abstract = {You are reading a book about a game. More specifically, the game
Cops and Robbers, which is played on a graph. Cops and Robbers,
in the form we study it, was first introduced in the early 1980s, and
a robust body of work on the topic has been growing steadily ever
since. At its core, it is a game played with a set of cops (controlled by
one player) trying to capture the robber (controlled by the opposing
player). The cops and the robber are restricted to vertices, and they
move each round to neighboring vertices. The smallest number of
cops needed to capture the robber is the cop number. Such a simplesounding game leads to quite a complex theory, as you will learn.
A formal introduction to the game and the cop number is given in
Chapter 1. Despite the fact that the game is nearly three decades
old, the last five years however, have seen an explosive growth in
research in the field. Some newer work settles some old problems,
while novel approaches, both probabilistic, structural, and algorithmic, have emerged on this classic game on graphs.}

We review an algorithmic characterization and structural description due to Nowakowski and Winkler. Then we consider the general situation where n cops chase the robber.

  abstract = {This paper surveys the similarities and differences between the game of cops and robbers
and classes of related games. The game of cops and robbers is a class of pursuit–evasion
games played on a finite graph. The players comprise a set of cops and a robber located on
vertices of the graph, and they move alternately along edges of the graph. The cops win the
game if at least one cop occupies the same vertex of the robber in finite time; otherwise, the
robber wins. Quilliot (Jeux de points fixes sur les graphes, These de 3ieme Cycle, Universite
de Paris VI, Paris, pp 131–145, 1978) and Nowakowski and Winkler (Discrete Math 43:235–
239, 1983) were among the first to study this class of games. The main questions studied
in the literature of cops and robbers games are on the class of graphs that characterize copwin games, on the minimum number of cops needed for classes of graphs to be cop-win,
on a conjecture due Meyniel (Personal communication, 1985) about the cop number of a
graph and more recently on the game played on random and/or infinite graphs (Bonato
and Nowakowski in The game of cops and robbers, Student mathematical library, vol 61,
American Mathematical Society, Providence, 2010; Bonato and Pralat in Graph searching
games and probabilistic methods, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2017). While the game of cops
and robbers is not traditionally modeled in the language of extensive game theory (Kuhn,
in: Kuhn, Tucker (eds) Contributions to the theory of games II, Princeton University Press,
Princeton, 1953), Kehagias et al. (The role of visibility in pursuit/evasion games, 2014) give
a general framework for the game of cops and robbers that relate to extensive games. By
using the notion of “capture time,” they are able to represent the game using a standard
discrete dynamic game model with explicit payoff functions for the cops and the robber.
More recently, the game of cops and robbers has also been related to dynamic games with
state variables (Bonato and Macgillivray in Contrib Discrete Math, 2017) and discounted
stochastic games (Konstantinidis and Kehagias in Selfish cops and adversarial robber: multi}

  abstract = {This thesis explores a modified version of the Cops and Robber game, which itself is a discrete version of searching networks. In this version of the game, there
are two cops playing with partial information provided by various types of technology. There are two types of information available, that which is provided via
devices placed on selected edges of a graph, and that provided via devices placed
on selected vertices. Since the information may or may not indicate the robber’s
direction in addition to his position, the problem can be divided into four cases.
The thesis focuses on finding bounds for the amount of such information required
by two cops to guarantee the capture of the robber on copwin graphs. Schemes
for placing devices on graphs, together with corresponding strategies which the
cops need to follow, are given. More localized and much more efficient schemes
for placing devices on full complete k-ary trees, where k ≥ 2, are also given. Much
work has been done on this problem when only one cop is in pursuit of the robber,
which allows for a comparison of the performance of one cop versus that of two
cops when playing on the same graph.
Finally, another variation of the game is explored, where either one or two cops
play with partial information as well as visibility one, which allows the cops to
“see” all neighboring vertices. Some preliminary results on searching graphs, particularly trees, are given for one and two cops playing with visibility zero or one.}
